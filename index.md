As a PhD candidate in biological chemistry at the University of Michigan, I am passionate about understanding the molecular mechanisms that govern RNA biology and its impact on cell fitness. My research focuses on identifying the effect of pseudouridine synthase 7 (PUS7) localization on RNA substrate selection, translation, and cell fitness. I have developed expertise in RNA biology and nanopore sequencing, which are essential tools for my research. I am also an American Heart Association Predoctoral Fellow, where I apply my skills to investigate the role of PUS7 in cardiovascular diseases. I am driven by the potential of my research to contribute to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for various diseases.
